## main functionality of the authentication feature is as follows:
- Login: The user can enter their email and password to access the blog site. The system will validate the credentials and redirect the user to the home page. If the credentials are incorrect, the system will display an error message and ask the user to try again. The user can also choose to stay logged in by checking a checkbox.
- Registration: The user can create a new account by entering their name, email, password, and password confirmation. The system will check if the email is valid and not already registered. The system will also check if the password and password confirmation match and meet the minimum requirements (at least 8 characters, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character). If the registration is successful, the system will send a confirmation email to the user and redirect them to the login page. If the registration fails, the system will display an error message and ask the user to correct the input.
- Password reset: The user can request a password reset by entering their email. The system will check if the email is registered and send a password reset link to the user. The user can click on the link and enter a new password and password confirmation. The system will check if the new password and password confirmation match and meet the minimum requirements. If the password reset is successful, the system will redirect the user to the login page. If the password reset fails, the system will display an error message and ask the user to try again.
